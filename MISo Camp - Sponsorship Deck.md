# MISo Camp — Sponsorship Deck

**Framework:** Columbo (answer-first) with Trojan Horse opening
**Density:** Narrative
**Focal Statement:** The biggest bottleneck in AI adoption isn't technical — it's articulation. MISo Camp is the first intensive that teaches knowledge workers to close that gap, and the community is already forming.
**Metaphor family:** Navigation/captaincy (captain, navigate, chart, course)

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**Headline:** Make It So Camp: How to Become a Captain of AI

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
MISo Camp
Summer 2026 · Tokyo/Chiba · 5 Days · ~40 Participants
misocamp.com

**Design note:** Clean, confident. Logo top-left. Tagline centered. Location/date/URL in quiet type at bottom. No imagery competing with the words.

## Slide 2 — The Familiar Problem (Trojan Horse Entry)

**Headline:** Everyone is experimenting with AI. Almost no one knows how to talk about what's working.

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
Across industries, knowledge workers are running private experiments with AI tools. Researchers, strategists, operations leads, creatives — each struggling in isolation. There is no shared vocabulary. No pattern library. No moment where anyone says "here's what I'm learning" in a way that makes sense to people who aren't developers.

**Design note:** Dark background, single pull-quote typography. No images — let the silence of the statement do the work.

## Slide 3 — The Flip (Trojan Horse Reveal)

**Headline:** The bottleneck isn't technical skill. It's the ability to articulate what you actually want.

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
The people who succeed with AI aren't the most technical. They're the most precise. Years of writing code trained developers to specify intent — but that skill isn't about code. It's about clarity. Knowledge workers have deep expertise locked in intuition, pattern recognition, and judgment. They've never had to make it explicit. Until now.

**Design note:** Two-column contrast. Left: "Vague — 'Help me analyze our customer data'" in muted type. Right: "Articulated — 'Identify customers who purchased twice in Q1 but not Q2. Segment by channel. Flag 40%+ drop-off.'" in bold type. Visual makes the gap visceral.

## Slide 4 — The Answer (Columbo)

**Headline:** MISo Camp teaches articulation through building — for strategists, researchers, creatives, and operators.

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
A 5-day intensive in Tokyo where ~40 curated participants solve real problems from their own practice using AI. Not a hackathon. Not a lecture series. Participants arrive with a problem, build working tools, and discover that their implicit expertise — once made explicit — becomes reusable, shareable, and teachable to both humans and machines.

**Design note:** This is the "answer slide" — make it the most visually distinct in the deck. White space. Large type. One sentence headline dominates. Spotlight below in smaller, readable body text.

## Slide 5 — How It Works

**Headline:** Three loops turn intuition into method — each building on the last.

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
**Loop 1: Build** — Solve a real problem. Discover "I have methods I didn't know I had."
**Loop 2: Reuse** — Build bigger, using documented approaches from Loop 1. Experience "Writing it down made this faster."
**Loop 3: Share** — Collaborate using explicit protocols. Realize "My methods are teachable."

Theory explains experience — it never precedes it.

**Design note:** Three horizontal blocks or a simple spiral diagram. Each loop gets an icon and its one-line discovery quote. Minimal — this is a logic slide, not a data slide.

## Slide 6 — Who's Behind This

**Headline:** Built by practitioners who work at the intersection of culture, technology, and foresight.

**Spotlight — Co-Organizers:**

**Igor Schwarzmann** · Co-Organizer
Independent strategic consultant (20 years). Culture × technology. Works with organizations on AI strategy, brand/growth strategy, foresight, and scenario planning. Clients range from Fortune 500 to cultural institutions. [PLACEHOLDER: Add 1-2 specific credential highlights, photo]

PhD from MIT in complex systems. Research Associate at Oxford. Managing Director of EMIR Intelligence, advising 350+ CEOs on emerging technology and geopolitics. TED talk: 2M+ views.

**Design note:** Side-by-side portraits with short bios beneath. Professional but human — candid photos over headshots if possible. Equal visual weight.

## Slide 7 — Faculty

**Headline:** Expert practitioners lead modules — showing AI collaboration beyond code.

**Spotlight — Tutors:**

**Harper Reed** · Technologist & Entrepreneur
CTO of Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. Former Head of Commerce at PayPal. Currently CEO of 2389 Research (AI agents for commerce). MIT Media Lab Director's Fellow. Builds at the intersection of technology, culture, and civic infrastructure.

**[Tutor 2 — Name TBD]** · [Domain]
[PLACEHOLDER: 2-3 sentence bio. Ideal profile: non-developer practitioner using AI in their field.]

**[Tutor 3 — Name TBD]** · [Domain]
[PLACEHOLDER: 2-3 sentence bio.]

**[Tutor 4 — Name TBD]** · [Domain]
[PLACEHOLDER: 2-3 sentence bio.]

**[Tutor 5 — Name TBD]** · [Domain]
[PLACEHOLDER: 2-3 sentence bio.]

**Design note:** Grid of 5-6 portrait circles with name + one-line descriptor. Not full bios on slide — bios in appendix or speaker notes. The visual is "look at this group of people."

## Slide 8 — Who's Already Coming

**Design note:** Logo cloud or name grid — not a table. Show diversity of roles and domains visually. Highlight 3-4 recognizable names larger. The message is density and breadth, not individual detail.

## Slide 9 — Logistics

**Headline:** Five days in Tokyo, summer 2026. Curated. Intimate. Intense.

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
**When:** Summer 2026 (targeting early-to-mid July)
**Where:** Tokyo / Chiba area (venue in discussion with Chiba Tech)
**Size:** ~40 participants, curated — not open enrollment
**Format:** Half-day intensity (~6 hrs structured / day). Day 1 arrival + setup, Days 2-4 one loop per day, Day 5 demos + synthesis
**Cost to participants:** Free. No payment handling. Invitation-only.

**Design note:** Simple icon grid: calendar, map pin, people, clock. Clean info layout. This is a reference slide, not a story slide — make it scannable.

## Slide 10 — The Ask [WIP]

**Headline:** We're looking for sponsors who want early access to what's next.

**Spotlight (≤60 words):**
**What we need:** Sponsorship covering travel and lodging for organizers and tutors. No one is paid — this runs on commitment, not fees.

**What sponsors get:**
- Full access to insights, protocols, and frameworks produced during the camp
- 2-3 seats for your team to participate as learners alongside the cohort
- Brand association with a curated, high-signal community
- [PLACEHOLDER: Additional sponsor benefits TBD]

**Sponsorship tiers and specific amounts: TBD — in development.**

**Design note:** Two-column layout. Left: "What we need" (short, honest). Right: "What you get" (concrete list). No hard sell — the deck has already made the case. This slide just makes the exchange legible.
